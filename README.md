# Synopsys Yocto Build Manifest Import - import_yocto_build_manifest.py

# INTRODUCTION

This script is provided under an OSS license as an example of how to manage Yocto projects.

It does not represent any extension of licensed functionality of Synopsys software itself and is provided as-is, without warranty or liability.

# BACKGROUND

Synopsys Detect v6.0.0+ supports the ability to ingest the dependency tree from a Bitbake build (by invoking `bitbake -g`) and import components into a Black Duck project for Yocto version 2.0 and above. However, this creates a project based on the dependencies from the build process, not the components distributed in the build.

This script is intended to process the build manifest file created by a Yocto (BitBake) build process and identify matching OSS components to create a Black Duck project which will more closely represent the OSS components distributed in the build.

# DESCRIPTION

The `import_yocto_build_manifest.py` script uses the Yocto build manifest file created by the Bitbake build process.

The script has 2 modes of operation which are required to be executed in sequence to create a Black Duck project.

The first mode (`kblookup`) reads the build manifest file to create an output file of KB lookup matches for the components, also reporting a list of non-matches. Note that the script stops at 500 input components in order to avoid a timeout of the API connection session (20 minutes). The script can be re-run on the same build manifest file if more than 500 components need to be processed. An additional configuration (replacement) file is used to replace component strings in order to match components in the KB and also to skip unwanted components.

The output KB lookup file created by `kblookup` mode can then be reviewed and supplemented manually to replace or modify components to ensure correct matches during the import phase.

The second mode (`import`) reads the input component list and the KB match file to add manual components to the specified Black Duck project/version.

The following diagram explains the flow of data for the 2 modes:

# PREREQUISITES

Python 3 and the Black Duck https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python package must be installed and configured to enable the Python API scripts for Black Duck prior to using this script.

An API key for the Black Duck server must also be configured in the `.restconfig.json` file in the package folder.

# INSTALLATION

First install the `hub-rest-api-python` package:

    git clone https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python.git
    cd hub-rest-api-python
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install .
    
Extract this GIT repo into a folder (`git clone https://github.com/matthewb66/import_yocto_build_manifest`).

Configure the hub connection in the `.restconfig.json` file within the `import_yocto_build_manifest` folder - example contents:

    {
      "baseurl": "https://myhub.blackducksoftware.com",
      "api_token": "YWZkOTE5NGYtNzUxYS00NDFmLWJjNzItYmYwY2VlNDIxYzUwOmE4NjNlNmEzLWRlNTItNGFiMC04YTYwLWRBBWQ2MDFlMjA0Mg==",
      "insecure": true,
      "debug": false
    }

# USAGE

The `import_yocto_build_manifest.py` script must be invoked with one of the 2 modes kblookup or import as shown in the usage text below:

    usage: import_yocto_build_manifest [-h] {kblookup,import} ...
	
    Process or import component list into project/version

    positional arguments:
 	 {kblookup,import}  Choose operation mode
    kblookup         Process build manifest file to find matching KB URLs & export to
                     file
    import           Import build manifest file into specified Black Duck
                     project/version using KB URLs from supplied file

    optional arguments:
       -h, --help       show this help message and exit

## kblookup Mode

The `kblookup` mode requires a build manifest file as input. An output KB Lookup File will be created in this mode and the file can be specified (if not specified the default filename `kblookup.out` will be used). Additionally, an input KB Lookup File can optionally be specified which will be used to reuse previous matches, and the `-a` (or `--append`) option would ensure that all entries from the input KB Lookup File are copied to the output KB Lookup file (without the -a option, only components found in the build manifest list would be output to the kblookup file).

A replacement file (-r repfile) must also be specified which is used to replace component names to match in the KB and also define components to be skipped.

The -l option supports creating a list of matched and unmatched entries from the build manifest file written to the KBlookup file.

Note that `kblookup` mode stops at 500 components in order to stop a timeout of the API connection session (20 minutes). The script can be re-run in `kblookup` mode appending to the output KB Lookup file as many times as necessary on the same component list to match more than 500 components provided the output KB Lookup file is specified as input (`-k kbfile`).

The full list of options in `kblookup` mode can be displayed using the command:

    python3 import_yocto_build_manifest.py kblookup -h

Usage for kblookup mode is:

    usage: import_manifest kblookup [-h] -c COMPONENT_FILE -r REPLACE_FILE
                                [-k KBFILE] [-o OUTPUT] [-a] [-l LISTFILE]

Further explanation of options for kblookup mode is provided below:

    usage: import_manifest kblookup [-h] -c COMPONENT_FILE -r REPLACE_FILE
                                [-k KBFILE] [-o OUTPUT] [-a] [-l LISTFILE]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c COMPONENT_FILE, --component_file COMPONENT_FILE
                            Input component list file
      -r REPLACE_FILE, --replace_file REPLACE_FILE
                            File of input component name replacement strings and SKIP
                            component strings
      -k KBFILE, --kbfile KBFILE
                            Input file of KB component IDs matching manifest components
      -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                            Output file of KB component IDs matching manifest components
                            (default "kblookup.out")
      -a, --append          Append new KB URLs to the KB Lookup file specified in -k
      -l LISTFILE, --listfile LISTFILE
                            Create an output file of component matches

## import Mode

The `import` mode requires a component list file and a KB Lookup File to be specified and will lookup the components in the KB Lookup File to add new manual components to the specified Black Duck project/version (which can be created by the script if they do not already exist subject to permissions).

The full list of options in import mode can be displayed using the command:

    import_manifest.py import -h

The usage for import mode is:

    usage: import_manifest import [-h] -k KBFILE -p PROJECT -v VERSION -c COMPONENT_FILE

Further explanation of options for import mode:

    -c COMPONENT_FILE, --component_file COMPONENT_FILE
                        REQUIRED Input component list file.

    -k KBFILE, --kbfile KBFILE
                        REQUIRED input KB Lookup file â€“ list of KB component IDs and URLs
                        matching manifest components, created by kblookup mode and 
                        optionally modified manually.

    -p PROJECT, --project PROJECT
                        REQUIRED Black Duck project name; if project does not exist (and 
                        API user has Global Project Creator permission) then a new project 
                        will be created.

    -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        REQUIRED Black Duck version name; if version does not exist then 
                        new version will be created.

    -d, --delete
                        OPTIONAL Delete existing manual components from the project; if
                        not specified then components will be added to the existing list.

# BUILD MANIFEST FILE

The build manifest file is created by a Bitbake build process and is located in <project path>/build/tmp/deploy/images/<machine name>/<image name>-<machine name>.manifest by default - for example /home/myuser/my_yocto/build/tmp/deploy/images/wac-gen2/wac-core-image-wac-gen2.manifest. 

This is a (required) input file for both the `kblookup` and `import` modes which contains a list of component names and versions to be imported (one per line). It is specified using the `-c` (or `--component_file`) option (e.g. `-c compfile`).

# REPLACEMENT FILE

The replacement files is required in `kblookup` mode only and specified using `-r repfile`. The file can contain entries to replace component names (from the build manifest) with components in the KB.

The file format is shown below:
 
       <component_name>;<replacement_string>
       <skip_string>;SKIP 

The first line would replace <component_name> from the build manifest file with <replacement_string> for matching in the KB.

An example replacement file for a sample Yocto build manifest is included in this package.

# KB LOOKUP FILE

This is a file which contains information about the matches for components and versions in the Black Duck KnowledgeBase.

The KB Lookup File is produced as an output of the `kblookup` mode (using `-o outkbfile` or `--output outkbfile`) where components are looked up in the KB automatically. The KB Lookup file can also be specified as input in `kblookup` mode using `-k inkbfile` (or `--kbfile inkbfile`) options in order to reuse existing matches from a previous `kblookup` run, stopping the search for components in the KB and speeding the process.

The KB Lookup file is required by `import` mode as input.

The KB Lookup file is intended to be manually modified after being output from the `kblookup` mode to change component matches (selecting different KB components from the automatically matched ones) or to add additional components and versions which could not be matched automatically.

Records are entered 1 per line with fields separated by â€˜;â€™ (semi-colon) and terminated by â€˜;â€™.

Fields on each line are described below:
    REQUIRED:
    Field 1 = Local component name;
    Field 2 = KB component name; (information only)
    Field 3 = KB component source URL; (information only)
    Field 4 = KB component URL; (or "NO MATCH")
    OPTIONAL:
    Field 5 = Local component version string;
    Field 6 = KB Component version URL; (or "NO VERSION MATCH")
(Fields 5 & 6 can be repeated in pairs)

Fields 2 and 3 are provided for information only to assist with manual assessment of the automatic KB matches found by `kblookup` mode and are not used in the matching process in `import` mode.

Note that the `Xaw3d` component is shown with `NO MATCH` indicating it could not be found automatically in `kblookup` mode, so this entry could be manually modified to add component and/or version URLs manually â€“ see below.

# Modifying the KB Lookup File

Entries marked with `NO MATCH` in field 4 indicate that the automatic match process in `kblookup` mode could not find a matching package and version in the KB. The non-matched version string should also be indicated in fields 4 and 5 for example `;4.6.12;NO VERSION MATCH;`

The KB Lookup file can be modified to manually add identified matches if required. Note that if any `NO MATCH` entries in the KB Lookup file are not modified, `import` mode will not import the associated components to the project (they will be skipped).

To identify potential component matches, a manual search can be performed within the Black Duck portal using the search dialog. For example, a search for the `xaw3d` component has been performed below:

![](https://github.com/matthewb66/import_manifest/blob/master/images/im_searchkb.png)

Clicking on a component in the returned list will browse to the component landing page:
 
![](https://github.com/matthewb66/import_manifest/blob/master/images/im_compmatch.png)

If this is a good match for the required component, the URL of the component view page in the portal (https://hubeval39.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/64b691ee-345f-4345-b2c7-ebb838c853b6 above) can be used to populate the KB Lookup File by replacing `NO MATCH` with the component URL as follows:

    Xaw3d;;;NO MATCH;

should be replaced with:

    Xaw3d;;;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/64b691ee-345f-4345-b2c7-ebb838c853b6;

This will ensure that the import mode will use this KB component for adding new manual components in the Black Duck project, searching for the required component version within the KB component. If the component version cannot be found in the KB component, then no match will be made (and no component added to the project).

Note that it is possible to enter multiple entries for the same component name with different KB component URLs; all entries will be searched in sequence to match the required version string. For example, the following 2 lines would allow matches for 2 KB components in sequence for the same component string:

    Xaw3d;;;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/64b691ee-345f-4345-b2c7-ebb838c853b6;
    Xaw3d;;;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/392cc27a-548d-423e-ae6c-ee621026f104;

Explanation of how duplicate entries in the KB lookup file operate in practice:

-	Consider the component/version xaw3d-0.6.2 is in the input component list
-	The version string â€˜0.6.2â€™ will be searched in the first KB component found in the KB lookup file.
    o	if found, the line will be modified to add a version match for this version:
    Xaw3d;;;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/64b691ee-345f-4345-b2c7-ebb838c853b6;0.6.2;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/64b691ee-345f-4345-b2c7-ebb838c853b6/version/14498227-3e8d-471b-ab84-e4c8a5259e78;

-	If version â€˜0.6.2â€™ is not found in the first component, then the second KB component will be searched
    o	If found in the second KB component, then the associated component version will be added to the second line in the KB Match file.

If the required version string does not exist within the KB component, it is also possible to specify the version string and a specific version URL. For example:

1. The string `peterscomponent-1.0.6` is listed in the component list file
2. The component `peterscomponent` exists in the KB (URL = https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/b2168761-819b-40b7-83d4-ebabfbc7f110), but there is no version `1.0.6` available. However, version `1.0.3` is listed in the KB which is sufficiently close
3. The KB match output file should have a `peterscomponent` entry which looks like this:
    `peterscomponent;;;NO MATCH;1.0.6;NO VERSION MATCH;`
4. Modify the entry to add the component and version URLs for `peterscomponent` and version `1.0.3` as follows:
    `peterscomponent;;;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/b2168761-819b-40b7-83d4-ebabfbc7f110;1.0.6;https://hub.blackducksoftware.com/api/components/b2168761-819b-40b7-83d4-ebabfbc7f110/versions/7e8bc4b3-17b4-4da8-a79f-cb4cfb06de90;`
